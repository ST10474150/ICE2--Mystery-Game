Reflection

Design
We based the layout on a clean and centered mobile-friendly interface with easy inputs and buttons.

Challenges
- Managing state changes after each guess.
- Resettig the game properly on restart.
- Validating input and ensuring it was a number between 1 and 100.

Learnings
- Using `useState` to manage multiple values.
- Creating simple, user-friendly layouts in React Native.
- Handling mobile input events and using conditional logic.

Teamwork
We divided tasks like layout, logic, and styling. Collaboration was smooth. Next time, we’d test earlier to catch issues faster.
